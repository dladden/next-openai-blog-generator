This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

OpenAI's "Conversational AI" framework is designed to facilitate dynamic and interactive conversations.

Roles:

User: The User is you or the person interacting with the system. You provide input to the conversation and receive responses from the Assistant. Your inputs can be in the form of messages or prompts, and they guide the direction of the conversation.

Assistant: The Assistant is the language model, such as GPT-3.5-turbo, which generates responses based on the conversation's context. It takes the messages from both the User and the System as input and generates a coherent and contextually relevant response. The Assistant's responses are designed to simulate natural conversation.

System: The System is a part of the conversational setup that helps guide the behavior of the Assistant. It provides high-level instructions or context to the Assistant, helping it stay on topic or adopt a specific tone. The System's role is to influence the style, content, or behavior of the Assistant throughout the conversation.
